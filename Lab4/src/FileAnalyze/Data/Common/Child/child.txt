Putting an end to conflicts: Prescriptions for a peaceful future was the theme of the 2024 Annual Parliamentary Hearing, a joint initiative between the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) and the President of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA).
IPU President Tulia Ackson and UNGA President Denis Francis hosted some 300 participants, including parliamentarians, Speakers, advisers and experts from more than 70 countries at the United Nations Headquarters in New York, USA, on 8 and 9 February.
Jonathan Granoff, President of the Global Security Institute, was joined by Costa Ricaâ€™s Permanent Representative to the United Nations H.E. Ambassador Maritza Chan Valverde and UN Special Coordinator for Development Abdoulaye Mar Dieye.
With more than 50 conflicts raging around the world, and the risks of conflict growing further, the New Agenda for Peace places itself within a shifting geopolitical landscape in which long- standing grievances are being compounded by new sources of tensions and new tools of warfare. 
Founded in 1889 as part of the peace movement, the IPU today counts 180 member parliaments and 15 associate members around the world. It promotes peace, democracy and sustainable development and  provides a space for parliamentary dialogue, as a complement to efforts by the UN and other multilateral fora.
